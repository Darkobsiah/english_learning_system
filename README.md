# Description #
 Automation project for school learning. This is the innovative way that
 I am learning new words right now - by using them in sentences.
 To make something useful was my goal making this program. I am going to use it this year to prepare myself for the Final English Exam in 12th grade. How to use the script:
1. Input the words or phrases into a txt file every one on a new line.
2. Initialise another empty file (sentences_list.txt) in this example (or you can just change the path as you like) to save the written sentences.
3. Run the program and translate every word(https://translate.google.bg/?hl=bg), then put it in a sentence.
4. Once the program has been terminated the last step is re-reading the output file as many times as needed to memorise the whole sentences and then the meaning of the new words as well.
5. If that project helps you in one way or another don't forger to put a star on my sky ;)

# Knowledge stack #
 Starting from the biggest unit - Class, to the lowest - Variable, this project has both and many things in between.
With an SQLlite database on top... I used Exception class and try-except blocks to handle errors that could eventually
end the program itself. Functions are very common. I used them to separate the big problem into small ones which can be solved
easily. Following this pattern from the very beggining to this moment it really gives me the feeling of freedom to addi new features
whenever I want to. Nevertheless, appending, reading and deleting information from files is essetial for the project so the file-handling
is also on point. For the data-operation I mainly used lists and dictionaries. There were many for and while loops. I used hashing algorithms
that encrypt the password of the user and save it to the database in acceptable format. Another I used were the dict and list comprehensions. 
They saved me plenty lines of code and made everything much more readable which is the main reason I have ever used them. In one function
a ''__name__'' super method was defined it order to find which function has called the current one.
 To sum up, in this project I have used every one of the things I have learned since I started my Advanced Module and even more.
I am very glad to share you that because this is the main purpose of the project - to help others to learn.

# Adjustments #
Fork the repository and free to show imagination - change the script.
* express yourself
* add new functionality
* add try-except statements
* add more user-friendly messages
* add whatever you want and said feedback ;)
* JUST do NOT forget to *fork* and *star* the repo!
```python 
print('Thank you for the attention!' * n_times)
```
