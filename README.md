# English Learning System

## Mission
This project is not something random. I have developed this system in order to help others
to learn English. When I first started (02/11/23) my idea was to create something that
people will be happy to use. Program that automate any action in our lifestyle. An
old Chinese saying goes - "If you want to help others - help yourself first".
Because of that I came up with the idea of creating not a program but a whole system 
that enables you to learn English words in very innovative way. The reason I did it
could be my English Matura Exam or maybe it is just my love mixed with
dedication to the language itself. We will never know...
P.S, thank you *Zeyneb* - the girl gave me the essence of the main method and with this
made one of my dreams come true.


I have developed this system in order to help others to learn English. To make something useful was my goal making this program. I am going to use it this year to prepare myself for the Final English Exam in 12th grade.

## How to use it
1. Input the words or phrases into a txt file every one on a new line.
2. Initialise another empty file (sentences_list.txt) in this example (or you can just change the path as you like) to save the written sentences.
3. Run the program and translate every word(https://translate.google.bg/?hl=bg), then put it in a sentence.
4. Once the program has been terminated the last step is re-reading the output file as many times as needed to memorise the whole sentences and then the meaning of the new words as well.
5. If that project helps you in one way or another don't forger to put a star on my sky ;)

## Why writing whole sentences with the new words instead of just them?

It is proven by scientists that if you connect something that is unusual and new for you
with something familiar it will let to a neural connection in your brain. This is the
reason that stays behind the main method we use in this Learning System. Putting a new word
in a sentence that exposes the definition of the current word. After that connection happens
it become much more easier. Next time you hear or read this word your brain you give you the
whole sentence and you with that the definition will pops like a popcorn in front of your frozen face.


## Knowledge stack
 ### The first part of the project - *User Authentication*. 
In order to develop it I had used `try-except blocks` to handle errors with my `Custom Exceptions`, and `functions` to validate the User input.
`SQLlite database` is the place where the program saves the User credentials after `hashing the password` with the support of the
`hashlib` library. To `append` and `read` `data` `from` the `database` I have used `SQL` commands.
 ### The second part - *English Learning System*.
 
  `Functions` helped me to `separate` the `big problem` into `small ones` which I had
solved easily. Nevertheless, `file-handling` take big role in the project. We can append, read and delete information from files.
Data-types that are commonly used are `lists` and `dictionaries` with `comprehensions` on some places to make the code more `readable`.
This part of the project is dealing with some `super methods` like ''__name__''.
 #### To sum up, in this project I have used every one of the things I have learned since I started my path of learning Software Development. Not only that, but it helped me to learn much more. Now it is your time to use what I am offering you and `learn on your own` - [here](https://github.com/sldimitrov/english_learning_system/blob/main/learning_system_project/__main__.py)

## Adjustments

Fork the repository and free to show imagination - change the script.
* express yourself
* add new functionality
* add try-except statements
* add more user-friendly messages
* add whatever you want and said feedback ;)
* JUST do NOT forget to *fork* and *star* the repo!
```python 
n_times = float('inf')
print('Thank you for the attention!' * n_times)
```
